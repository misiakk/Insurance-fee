# Insurance-fee

**Dataset Description**
<br />The dataset consists of information regarding insurance premiums, including age, gender, smoking status, number of children, and region of residence.<br />

**Descriptive Statistics**
<br />Descriptive statistics for the variables in the dataset were computed.<br />

**Data Visualization**
<br />Various visualizations, including distribution plots and correlation matrices, were created using Python libraries for data visualization.<br />

**Distribution of Dependent Variable**
<br />A distribution plot of the dependent variable (insurance premium amount) was generated.<br />

**Model Building**
<br />Regression models were built using both statsmodels and sklearn. The determinants of insurance premium amounts were examined.<br />

**Prediction and Evaluation**
<br />Predictions were made on a test dataset, and model performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The results were visualized using plots.<br />

**Interpretation of Model Estimates**
<br />The estimated coefficients of the model and its statistical properties were interpreted.<br />

**Summary**
<br />The code provided in this repository models insurance premium amounts using linear regression. It explores the determinants of insurance premiums and evaluates the accuracy of the model using training and test datasets.<br />
